Module 19
### Summary
##### How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?

##### Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

##### If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?

### Code is [here](https://github.com/RudyR32/AlphabetSoup/blob/master/AlphabetSoupChallenge.ipynb).
