### Summary
##### How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I used a deep learning neural to predict the success of an organization.  So as to not overfit the model I only used 2 layers and 3 neurons in n layer and 2 neurons in the second layer.  I start with many more but did not see a mjor drop off at lowering to those levels 
##### Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Yes, my first attempts with both the Random forest and the Neural Network where above .99 accuracy.  My focus was more on not overfitting the model.  This was important because I wanted this to be usable with as little computing power as possible.
##### If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
The Random forest model was very quick to run and if the data was going to be stored in the manner that this was it would be my preference.
